Project Description : 

Email and messaging applications have become vital instruments in our lives, but the problem of spam messages remains. These unsolicited messages can clog inboxes and impede communication. This project seeks to develop an advanced spam detection system based on the most recent natural language processing (NLP) techniques, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs).

Instead of depending entirely on traditional methods, we'll look at how LLMs can improve spam detection. One way is to use tools such as the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to build meaningful text embeddings, which are then fed into a supervised learning model for categorization. Another approach uses LLMs to directly examine material and assess whether it is spam using prompts, demonstrating their capacity to evaluate information intuitively.

By incorporating these modern methodologies, we align with current advances in NLP while also responding to feedback indicating that earlier methods may no longer be the most effective. The study will compare the performance of these algorithms based on criteria such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

The objectives are twofold: to develop a dependable spam detection system that improves user experience, and to explore how LLMs might offer value to real-world challenges such as spam filtering. This work not only demonstrates the potential of cutting-edge NLP technologies, but also lays the groundwork for future advancements in this field.
